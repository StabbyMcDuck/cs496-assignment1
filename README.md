CS 496 Assignment 1: Hello Cloud

https://fierce-waters-33341.herokuapp.com/

Requirements

Program Requirements:

You must have a live page accessible by a web based URI (ex. http://google.com (Links to an external site.)). Simply having a page working locally is not sufficient.
The page must display some sort of dynamic data. This can be as simple as displaying the time or you can do something like interface with a weather api.
Documentation Requirements:

You must say what cloud provider you used.
Discuss how the provider offers a cloud service rather than a product (different providers have different offerings, is yours Infrastructure? It is a Platform?)
Upcoming assignments will require dynamic page generation based on user input (so you will need to be able to have the user input data then do something with that data) and they will require the use of a non-relational database. To this end, discuss what kind of options are available to implement advanced dynamic web pages with the cloud provider you used and how you will get access to a non-relational database. (These sorts of things will vary significantly if you are using a Platform as a service or Infrastructure as a service)
In a clearly labeled section of the document come up with at least two ideas for a web application that would be dynamic and store reasonably complex data. This would be similar to the sort of thing you did for a final project in your Databases or Web Development class.
Grading:

This assignment is worth 1/4 what a typical assignment would be worth.
The grading is largely pass/fail for each of the sections above. Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the documentation should probably be a minimum of 2 paragraphs each.
Deliverable:

Submit a PDF of the required documentation. In the first line of that PDF include a link to your live website.
After you submit your assignment also add a comment with the URL. For some reason Canvas has a tendency to remove the '-' character in PDFs.
